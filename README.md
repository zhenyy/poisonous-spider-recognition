# Spider recognition mobile app
This repository contains codes and scripts for our research project: a mobile deep learning application that recognises Australian venomous spider in real time

## Things that we used
- The project is not possible without this nice series of tutorials created by [pyimagesearch](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/):  
[How to (quickly) build a deep learning image dataset](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/09/how-to-quickly-build-a-deep-learning-image-dataset/)  
[Keras and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/16/keras-and-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns/)  
[Running Keras models on iOS with CoreML](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/23/running-keras-models-on-ios-with-coreml/)  

- Two handy tools for building image datasets for computer vision:  
[Bing Image Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-image-search-api/)
